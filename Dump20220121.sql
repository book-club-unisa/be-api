It was his first perception of the dematerialization of an object and presaged the later development of his influential theories of non-objective art.During study and travel in Europe, the young artist breathed the heady atmosphere of artistic experimentation. Fauvism, Cubism, Symbolism, and other movements played an important role in the development of his own revolutionary approach to painting. Decrying literal representation, Kandinsky emphasized instead the importance of form, color, rhythm, and the artist\'s inner need in expressing reality.In Point and Line to Plane, one of the most influential books in 20th-century art, Kandinsky presents a detailed exposition of the inner dynamics of non-objective painting. Relying on his own unique terminology, he develops the idea of point as the \"proto-element\" of painting, the role of point in nature, music, and other art, and the combination of point and line that results in a unique visual language. He then turns to an absorbing discussion of line — the influence of force on line, lyric and dramatic qualities, and the translation of various phenomena into forms of linear expression. With profound artistic insight, Kandinsky points out the organic relationship of the elements of painting, touching on the role of texture, the element of time, and the relationship of all these elements to the basic material plane called upon to receive the content of a work of art.Originally published in 1926, this essay represents the mature flowering of ideas first expressed in Kandinsky\'s earlier seminal book, Concerning the Spiritual in Art. As an influential member of the Bauhaus school and a leading theoretician of abstract expressionism, Kandinsky helped formulate the modern artistic temperament. This book amply demonstrates the importance of his contribution and its profound effect on 20th-century art.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408469531l/352807.jpg'),('978-0-01-584495-0','God Save The Child','Robert B.

He campaigned ceaselessly for African solidarity and for the liberation of southern Africa from white settler rule. His greatest achievement was to win the right of black peoples in Africa to have a vote and to determine their own destiny.He turned a dream of liberation into a political reality. He was the leader of Ghana who urged Africa to shed the colonial yoke and who inspired black people everywhere to seek their freedom.This revised edition of Birmingham\'s fine and accessible biography chronicles the public accomplishments of this extraordinary leader, who faced some of the century\'s most challenging political struggles over colonial transition. African nationalism, and pan-Africanism. It also relates some of the personal trials of a complex individual.As a student in America in the late 1930s, Nkrumah, shy, disorganized, but ambitious and persistent, earned four degrees in ten years. For political training he then went to England. Nkrumah found writing difficult throughout his lifetime, but once back in his African homeland, with its oral heritage, Nkrumah blossomed as a charming conversationalist, a speechmaker, and eventually a visionary and inspiring leader.Nkrumah\'s crusades were controversial, however, and in the 1960s he gradually lost his heroic stature both among his own people and among his fellow leaders. He lived his last years in exile.This remarkable life story, which touches on many of the issues facing modern Africa, will open a window of understanding for the general leader as well as for graduate and undergraduate classes.In this new edition, Birmingham also examines Nkrumah\'s exile and provides insight into the image of Nkrumah that has emerged in the light of research recently published.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389310727l/353157.jpg'),('978-0-02-098305-7','Turning Hearts','Deanne Blackhurst',179,'Einaudi','Amanda knows there\'s a family out there that needs the gospel - and she also knows she\'s the one who\'s supposed to bring it to them.

A masterful work and a cracking good read.” —Valerie Hemingway, author of Running With the Bulls: My Years with the Hemingways Ernest Hemingway was not only one of the most important 20th-century American writers, but also a man whose adventurous and colorful life has become the stuff of legend. War correspondent, ambulance driver, and big-game hunter, he was married four times and his love life was inextricably bound up with his artistic endeavors. His first marriage to Hadley Richardson—with whom he lived in Paris in the early 1920s—has long fascinated readers. Their passionate, complicated, and ultimately “doomed” relationship coincided with Hemingway’s formative years as a member of the so-called Lost Generation, and the failed marriage had a lifelong impact on the man and his writing. In The Paris Husband, author and Hemingway scholar Scott Donaldson deftly separates fact from fiction to present a spellbinding and clear-eyed account of this seminal period in Hemingway’s life. Brilliantly utilizing all essential primary and secondary sources—including the author’s notebooks and drafts—Donaldson breathes new life into this ageless story, providing revelatory insights into Hemingway’s character and exploring the nuances of a magical, yet troubled, love affair. For anyone interested in Hemingway’s development as an artist and why, as an older man, he continued to revisit this transformative and painful episode in his life, The Paris Husband is a lucid, accessible, and compelling narrative that will engage both diehard Hemingway fans, as well as those just discovering this iconic writer.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1531562324l/40805986.jpg'),('978-0-05-662256-2','1970s Bollywood: The 50 Must See Hindi Movies','Sabeha Peach',118,'Einaudi','Bollywood in the 1970’s stands out because it was the true dawn of modern Indian cinema.

Only two obstacles stand between her and happiness. First there\'s Hideki; he\'s been struggling with the idea that a person can have feelings for a machine. Can her return her love? Second is the mysterious Zima and Dita. Having run out of patience, they\'re quickly closing in to deactivate Chi before her strong emotions pose a threat to persocoms everywhere.Chapters 82–88','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1274418713l/1087173.jpg'),('978-0-258-72326-5','El viejo y el mar','Ernest Hemingway',157,'Einaudi','Con un lenguaje de gran fuerza y sencillez, El viejo y el mar narra la historia de un viejo pescador cubano a quien la suerte parece haber abandonado, y del desafío mayor al que se enfrenta: la batalla despiadada y sin tregua con un pez gigantesco en las aguas del golfo.

They pretend not to know that the second we get off the bus (scratch that, he’s not even going to wait for that second; it happens before the bus has even come to a complete stop), he’ll lower that arm over my shoulders, or drop his hand forward to f**k with my hair and knuckle my neck a little. He’s like that: likes touching me in public, holding hands, kissing, and he does it in that easy way of his – with a Rylan-specific brand of confidence that almost makes people around us forget to look twice.

I don’t. * * * A brave and funny love story about the anxieties, insecurities, and heartaches that drive people apart and bring them back together, It’s Like This is the journey of Niles and Rylan, as they learn to communicate in the shadow of a life-changing illness. Niles and Rylan have been together a long time. They have great sex, they are deeply intimate, and Rylan never holds back on displaying his affection. As far as their family and friends are concerned, they’re an established couple, and yet, after three years of being “together,” Niles is still unsure if they’re actually in a relationship. As their sexual intensity reaches a dangerous tipping point, Niles must find the courage to articulate how he feels in order to try and keep the only thing he has ever wanted.

So will The Longest Memory, the powerful, beautifully crafted, internationally acclaimed fictional debut of prizewinning Guyanese poet Fred D\'Aguiar. In language extraordinary for its tautness and resonance, The Longest Memory tells the story of a rebellious, fiercely intelligent young slave, who in 1810 attempts to flee a Virginia plantation - and of his father who inadvertently betrays him. The young slave\'s love for a white girl who slakes his forbidden thirst for learning and his painful relationship with his father are hauntingly evoked in this novel of astonishing lyrical simplicity. It is a measure of D\'Aguiar\'s achievement and bravery that The Longest Memory is informed not only by the complicities between black slave and white master but also by the tensions among slaves themselves - between stoic survivalists and passionate rebels. Remarkable for its keenness of observation, subtlety, and restraint, The Longest Memory heralds the arrival of a major new voice in the contemporary literature of the African diaspora.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356453647l/969310.jpg'),('978-0-298-59803-8','The Emperor\'s Dragon, #1','G.G.

Although it’s a paradise for some, Dr. Countryman has never felt more alone. As his fortieth birthday approaches, he reevaluates his past relationships and prays that God will guard his heart so it will not be broken again. If only there was a way he could be sure of God’s will.“God says that a man is not meant to live alone always.”As a child, Shelley watched her mother lose the battle against breast cancer. In her late teens, she survived a major hurricane with her father while living in Southwest Florida. Now twenty-five, Shelley Roberts is a furniture repairwoman who believes in being prepared for every contingency while enjoying life and seizing the moment.A random encounter throws these two people into each other’s lives. Soon after, Shelley is assigned to do some work at Mark’s church. As they spend more time together, a relationship slowly begins to blossom, though whether they’re “friends” or “more” is something neither of them is certain of.While growing closer to Mark, Shelley encourages him to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season—something she had to learn to do some years before. Though a woman of faith, her life’s experiences have taught her that preparation is necessary. She is enthusiastic in this belief, even when Mark tries to get her to relax and have faith in God’s protection.Their beliefs will be tested when hurricane season begins in earnest and a storm grows in strength as it nears the Florida Peninsula.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Praise for An Unexpected Woman:Mark and Shelley complement each other well. She loosens him up a bit and he tempers her. In the beginning Shelley keeps a professional distance since Mark is considered a client. Mark has some reservations regarding their age difference and because of Shelley’s delight in and insistence on their friendship. The progression of their relationship is sweet and believably Christian based. - IvyD for Manic Readers* * *One of my favourite things is when Mark and Shelley get cheeky with each other. Each knows how to keep the other from getting in a funk. And the flirting is awesome. There are some great romantic moments that are perfectly in keeping with godly conduct. - Jess Molly on Goodreads* * *The author also picks up on themes of family and friendship, as well as the need to compromise in any relationship.Overall, this was a satisfying read. Much in the tone of a Karen Kingsbury novel, this book should appeal to those who love Christian romances. - Sandra for myfictionnook.com','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347656998l/8105187.jpg'),('978-0-367-95832-9','Pedagogy of the Oppressed','Paulo Freire|Myra Bergman Ramos',164,'Einaudi','This text argues that the ignorance and lethargy of the poor are the direct result of the whole economic, social and political domination.

It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind—the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud\'s books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man\'s place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual\'s quest for freedom and society\'s demand for conformity.Freud\'s theme is that what works for civilization doesn\'t necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud\'s major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438544596l/357636.jpg'),('978-0-521-97883-5','The Time Machine','H.G.

Siegel|Tina Payne Bryson',192,'Einaudi','Your toddler throws a tantrum in the middle of a store. Your preschooler refuses to get dressed. Your fifth-grader sulks on the bench instead of playing on the field. Do children conspire to make their parents’ lives endlessly challenging? No—it’s just their developing brain calling the shots!In this pioneering, practical book, Daniel J. Siegel, neuropsychiatrist and author of the bestselling Mindsight, and parenting expert Tina Payne Bryson demystify the meltdowns and aggravation, explaining the new science of how a child’s brain is wired and how it matures. The “upstairs brain,” which makes decisions and balances emotions, is under construction until the mid-twenties. And especially in young children, the right brain and its emotions tend to rule over the logic of the left brain. No wonder kids can seem—and feel—so out of control. By applying these discoveries to everyday parenting, you can turn any outburst, argument, or fear into a chance to integrate your child’s brain and foster vital growth. Raise calmer, happier children using twelve key strategies, including • Name It to Tame It: Corral raging right-brain behavior through left-brain storytelling, appealing to the left brain’s affinity for words and reasoning to calm emotional storms and bodily tension.• Engage, Don’t Enrage: Keep your child thinking and listening, instead of purely reacting.• Move It or Lose It: Use physical activities to shift your child’s emotional state.• Let the Clouds of Emotion Roll By: Guide your children when they are stuck on a negative emotion, and help them understand that feelings come and go.• SIFT: Help children pay attention to the Sensations, Images, Feelings, and Thoughts within them so that they can make better decisions and be more flexible.• Connect Through Conflict: Use discord to encourage empathy and greater social success. Complete with clear explanations, age-appropriate strategies for dealing with day-to-day struggles, and illustrations that will help you explain these concepts to your child, The Whole-Brain Child shows you how to cultivate healthy emotional and intellectual development so that your children can lead balanced, meaningful, and connected lives.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320559286l/10353369.jpg'),('978-0-8262-8058-9','The Pocket Watch','Ceci Giltenan',171,'Einaudi','When Maggie Mitchell, is transported to the thirteenth century Highlands will Laird Logan Carr help mend her broken heart or put it in more danger than before?

Che però l’ha abbandonata. Smarrita e disperata, si ritrova a vivere a casa dei suoi nonni, morti a distanza di pochi giorni e simbolo di un amore perfetto, capace di fare vincere la passione sul tempo che passa: proprio quello che non è riuscito al matrimonio di Giò. La notte di San Valentino, festa che lei ha sempre ignorato, Giò trova un biglietto che sua nonna aveva scritto all’angelo custode, per ringraziarlo. Con lo sconforto, ma anche il coraggio, di chi non ha niente da perdere, Giò ci prova: scrive anche lei al suo angelo. Che, incredibilmente, le risponde. E le fa una promessa: avrò cura di te. Poi rilancia. L’angelo non solo ha una fortissima personalità, ma ha un nome: Filèmone, ha una storia. Soprattutto ha la capacità di comprendere Giò come Giò non si è mai compresa. Di ascoltarla come non si è mai ascoltata. Nasce così uno scambio intenso, divertente, divertito, commovente, che coinvolge anche le persone che circondano Giò: il puntiglioso ex marito, la madre fricchettona, l’amica intrappolata in una relazione extraconiugale, una deflagrante guida turistica argentina, un ragazzino che vuole rinchiudersi in una comune... Uno scambio che indaga non solo le mancate ragioni di Giò: ma le mancate ragioni di ognuno di loro. Perché a ognuno di loro, grazie a Filèmone, voce dell’interiorità prima che dell’aldilà, sia possibile silenziare la testa e l’istinto. Per ascoltare il cuore. Anche e soprattutto quando è chiamato a rispondere a prove complicate, come quella a cui sarà messa davanti Giò proprio dal suo fedele Filèmone, in un finale sorprendente che sembrerà confondere tutto.

How and Why God Evolved highlights the link among pagan, polytheistic, and monotheistic beliefs. Khan points out misrepresentations of Holy Scriptures and discusses some of the political reasons involved. He brings to the forefront the importance of understanding how the notion of God evolved throughout history, in keeping with the human brain’s development. He also shows how God and humans have fashioned each other in an attempt to understand and reach one another. Khan exposes the textual commonalities among Holy Books and shows how modern-day religions spring from previous religions. How and Why God Evolved discusses why no one religion is truly unique or separate from others.

The \"large old house\" on the Calle Cueto, where her mother was born and which her grandfather evoked so frequently that Isabel felt as if she had lived there, became the protagonist of her first novel, The House of the Spirits. It appears again at the beginning of Allende\'s playful, seductively compelling memoir My Invented Country, and leads us into this gifted writer\'s world.Here are the almost mythic figures of a Chilean family -- grandparents and great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends -- with whom readers of Allende\'s fiction will feel immediately at home. And here, too, is an unforgettable portrait of a charming, idiosyncratic Chilean people with a violent history and an indomitable spirit. Although she claims to have been an outsider in her native land -- \"I never fit in anywhere, not into my family, my social class, or the religion fate bestowed on me\" -- Isabel Allende carries with her even today the mark of the politics, myth, and magic of her homeland. In My Invented County, she explores the role of memory and nostalgia in shaping her life, her books, and that most intimate connection to her place of origin.Two life-altering events inflect the peripatetic narration of this book: The military coup and violent death of her uncle, Salvador Allende Gossens, on September 11, 1973, sent her into exile and transformed her into a writer. The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, on her newly adopted homeland, the United States, brought forth from Allende an overdue acknowledgment that she had indeed left home. My Invented Country, whose structure mimics the workings of memory itself, ranges back and forth across that distance accrued between the author\'s past and present lives. It speaks compellingly to immigrants, and to all of us, who try to retain a coherent inner life in a world full of contradictions.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1405046012l/16528.jpg'),('978-1-161-12110-0','Me & My Prince Charming','Orizuka',200,'Einaudi','Andromeda Arastya adalah cowok yang baru saja dinobatkan sebagai The Most Wanted Male di sekolahku.

He is pleading that God himself, as revealed in Christ\'s death and resurrection, is the ultimate and greatest gift of the gospel.None of Christ\'s gospel deeds and none of our gospel blessings are good news except as means of seeing and savoring the glory of Christ. Forgiveness is good news because it opens the way to the enjoyment of God himself. Justification is good news because it wins access to the presence and pleasures of God himself. Eternal life is good news because it becomes the everlasting enjoyment of Christ.All God\'s gifts are loving only to the degree that they lead us to God himself. That is what God\'s love is: his commitment to do everything necessary (most painfully the death of his only Son) to enthrall us with what is most deeply and durably satisfying-namely, himself.Saturated with Scripture, centered on the cross, and seriously joyful, this book leads us to satisfaction for the deep hungers of the soul. It touches us at the root of life where practical transformation gets its daily power. It awakens our longing for Christ and opens our eyes to his beauty.Piper writes for the soul-thirsty who have turned away empty and in desperation from the mirage of methodology. He invites us to slow down and drink from a deeper spring. \"This is eternal life,\" Jesus said, \"that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.\" This is what makes the gospel-and this book-good news.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388973591l/253916.jpg'),('978-1-390-22341-5','Chloe of the Night','Keith Kekic',198,'Einaudi','Sequel to Nightwalkers.

Taking examples from the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, The Poetics introduces into literary criticism such central concepts as mimesis (‘imitation’), hamartia (‘error’), and katharsis (‘purification’).

First translated into English in 1967 as The Burning Plain, these starkly realistic stories create a psychologically acute portrait of poverty and dignity in the countryside at a time when Mexico was undergoing rapid industrialization following the upheavals of the Revolution. According to Ilan Stavans, the stories’ “depth seems almost inexhaustible: with a few strokes, Rulfo creates a complex human landscape defined by desolation. These stories are lessons in morality. . . . They are also astonishing examples of artistic distillation.”To introduce a new generation of readers to Rulfo’s unsurpassable literary talents, this new translation repositions the collection as a classic of world literature. Working from the definitive Spanish edition of El llano en llamas established by the Fundación Juan Rulfo, Ilan Stavans and co-translator Harold Augenbram present fresh translations of the original fifteen stories, as well as two more stories that have not appeared in English before—“The Legacy of Matilde Arcángel” and “The Day of the Collapse.” The translators have artfully preserved the author’s “peasantisms,” in appreciation of the distinctive voices of his characters. Such careful, elegiac rendering of the stories perfectly suits Rulfo’s Mexico, in which people on the edge of despair nonetheless retain a sense of self, of integrity that will not be taken away.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1339011491l/13699329.jpg'),('978-1-399-58123-3','Penguin: Pain and Prejudice','Gregg Hurwitz|Szymon Kudranski|Jason Aaron|Jason Pearson',144,'Einaudi','Bestselling author Gregg Hurwitz examines the painful and dark past of one of Batman\'s most devious foes.

Jenny Offill\'s heroine, referred to in these pages as simply \"the wife,\" once exchanged love letters with her husband postmarked Dept. of Speculation, their code name for all the uncertainty that inheres in life and in the strangely fluid confines of a long relationship. As they confront an array of common catastrophes - a colicky baby, a faltering marriage, stalled ambitions - the wife analyzes her predicament, invoking everything from Keats and Kafka to the thought experiments of the Stoics to the lessons of doomed Russian cosmonauts. She muses on the consuming, capacious experience of maternal love, and the near total destruction of the self that ensues from it as she confronts the friction between domestic life and the seductions and demands of art. With cool precision, in language that shimmers with rage and wit and fierce longing, Jenny Offill has crafted an exquisitely suspenseful love story that has the velocity of a train hurtling through the night at top speed. Exceptionally lean and compact, Dept. of Speculation is a novel to be devoured in a single sitting, though its bracing emotional insights and piercing meditations on despair and love will linger long after the last page.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411927412l/18473997.jpg'),('978-1-4646-5260-8','Akiko and the Alpha Centauri 5000','Mark Crilley',176,'Einaudi','Akiko and her crew–Spuckler Boach, Mr. Beeba, Poog, and Gax–are competing in an intergalactic race from one side of the universe to the other.

Now, for the first time, the miners tell their own story--in a dramatic, riveting first-person account of their actions and emotions and of how they managed to make it through the traumatic accident and rescue. The men were below ground when water trapped in an adjacent mine burst through the wall of the new mine they were working. Scrambling to avoid the sluicing tide that rapidly rose in the narrow passageway, the crew knew they were in serious trouble. Moe, who was trapped on the other side of the raging stream, alone and away from the others, thought he would die then and there. However, in a heroic effort, Randly Fogle, crew chief, drove the scoop machinery straight into the flood and Moe managed to leap into it, and thus was carried to relative safety. Now all together, the miners moved to the best location they could find in the freezing-cold, still-rising water. They recount their fears, their prayers, their confessions to one another, and how they kept up their hope that they\'d get out alive, while trying to decide how to drown with dignity. Meanwhile, we see the agony their wives, girlfriends, and families were going through, not knowing if they were living or dead. Once a resuce was imminent, the men reveal how they decided who would be the last man up.

The Real Book of the Dead allows you to be with the dead as they relive their final moments of life through Murder, Suicide, Drug Overdoses, Auto Accidents and more. Their riveting accounts brings comfort even in the darkest hours that life does indeed go on after death. Meet Joe’s Wife, a widower visited by her spirit guide who gives her the strength and comfort to fight Breast Cancer and begin a new life. Meet Florence, caught in bed with another man, who was brutally raped and savagely beaten to death by her loverAfter reading their life and death stories, you may never be the same. The comfort, wisdom and the eternal answers to questions which we all seek are finally, stunningly revealed.These are genuine life and death stories of real people. As a medium and channel, Collette Sinclaire has brought their life stories and information forward for you. These are the honest and heartfelt narratives of lives lost, loves lost, opportunities taken and opportunities missed. You will read about great achievement and great heartbreak. You will learn some of the reasons why we are here, what it feels like to die and what awaits us on the other side. Collette has endured the difficult process of being the conduit for these souls to be able to tell their personal and often difficult tales of life and death, to be presented here. They have been related through her for all of us to better understand why we are here and that we are all the same underneath. That what we are all looking for is basically the same, but rarely do we recognize our deep inner need for happiness through fulfillment of our soul\'s true calling; that is, those things which we seem to hear from our conscience, or that \"inner voice\" that spurs you to follow your dreams and your heart. This book is the culmination of many years of interviews with the dead. These chronicles of lives lived, though sometimes sorrowful, are not meant to sadden you, but to light the way to understanding. It is each soul\'s hope that by learning from their own life lessons - both from lessons they had successfully completed as well as those that they had failed - that you will find the way to a more contented life as well as a more powerful and happier self. These are not words to entertain or sway you. They are simply the words of lives once lived and what happened to these souls and what they experienced when they died. Some may strike a chord with you. Some may make your heart soar and others may make your heart sink, but they are all important in their own way. You may even recognize the voice of a departed soul as being similar to your own and in the process, find out why you are here yourself. If you have lost someone or are going through difficult times yourself, perhaps the information in these interviews can bring you understanding and comfort into your own life when you need it most.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377807566l/18397370.jpg'),('978-1-57782-131-1','Kiai Nyentrik Membela Pemerintah','Abdurrahman Wahid|Mohamad Sobary',133,'Einaudi','Profiles of Indonesian ulamas, previously published in Tempo.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1268279279l/7803610.jpg'),('978-1-58110-190-4','The Wall','Jean-Paul Sartre',183,'Einaudi','\'The Wall\', the lead story in this collection, introduces three political prisoners on the night prior to their execution.

O que impulsiona os personagens é a seca, áspera e cruel, e paradoxalmente a ligação telúrica, afetiva, que expõe naqueles seres em retirada, à procura de meios de sobrevivência e um futuro. Apesar desse sentimento de transbordante solidariedade e compaixão com que a narrativa acompanha a miúda saga do vaqueiro Fabiano e sua gente, o autor contou: Procurei auscultar a alma do ser rude e quase primitivo que mora na zona mais recuada do sertão... os meus personagens são quase selvagens... pesquisa que os escritores regionalistas não fazem e nem mesmo podem fazer ...porque comumente não são familiares com o ambiente que descrevem...Fiz o livrinho sem paisagens, sem diálogos. E sem amor. A minha gente, quase muda, vive numa casa velha de fazenda. As pessoas adultas, preocupadas com o estômago, não tem tempo de abraçar-se. Até a cachorra [Baleia] é uma criatura decente, porque na vizinhança não existem galãs caninos.Vidas secas é o livro em que Graciliano, visto como antipoético e anti-sonhador por excelência, consegue atingir, com o rigor do texto que tanto prezava, um estado maior de poesia.','https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1376282041l/334227.jpg'),('978-1-903117-94-1','Warriors: Tigerstar and Sasha #1: Into the Woods','Erin Hunter|Dan Jolley|Don Hudson',112,'Einaudi','A graphic novel adventure from the world of Erin Hunter’s #1 nationally bestselling Warriors series!In the first book of the Tigerstar & Sasha manga arc, a kittypet named Sasha searches for a new home—and wonders if she might find it with ShadowClan and its leader, Tigerstar, during the events of the Warriors: The Prophecies Begin series.When Sasha is forced to leave her kittypet home, she must forge a solitary new life in the forest.
